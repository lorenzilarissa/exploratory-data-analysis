# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project

This project showcases my abilities in statistics, data science, and machine learning using Python. It includes various analyses, visualizations, and statistical tests performed on a random dataset.

## Project Overview

In this project, I've used Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciPy to perform data analysis and machine learning tasks. The main components of the project include:

1. Basic Statistics: Calculation of mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance of the dataset.
2. Histogram: Visualization of the dataset's distribution using a histogram with overlaid mean, median, and mode.
3. Box Plot: Visualization of the dataset's distribution using a box plot, including the interquartile range (IQR), median, and identification of outliers.
4. Q-Q Plot: Visualization of the dataset's quantiles against a normal distribution to assess normality.
5. T-Test: Statistical test to determine if the mean of the dataset is significantly different from a specified value.
6. Correlation Analysis: Calculation of the correlation coefficient and visualization of the relationship between two variables using a scatter plot.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: git clone [https://github.com/lorenzilarissa/exploratory-data-analysis.git](https://github.com/lorenzilarissa/nltk-sentiment-analysis/)
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Python script: `python analysis_script.py`

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a randomly generated dataset with 100 data points, following a normal distribution with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2. This synthetic dataset allows for the demonstration of various statistical analyses and visualizations.

## Results and Interpretations

The project generates various statistical results and visualizations, providing insights into the dataset. Here are the main findings:

- Basic statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and variance give an overview of the dataset's central tendency and variability.
- The histogram visualizes the dataset's distribution, with the overlaid mean, median, and mode providing reference points.
- The box plot summarizes the dataset's distribution, including the interquartile range (IQR), median, and identification of outliers.
- The Q-Q plot assesses the normality of the data by comparing its quantiles to those of a normal distribution.
- The t-test determines if the mean of the dataset is significantly different from a specified value.
- The correlation analysis measures the relationship between two variables and visualizes it using a scatter plot.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my proficiency in utilizing Python for data analysis, statistics, and machine learning tasks. By performing various analyses and visualizations on a random dataset, it showcases the ability to extract meaningful insights and make data-driven decisions.
